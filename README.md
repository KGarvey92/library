# Library Project

This project was my first time working with object constructors, and later, javascript classes using the new syntax.

It also provided me with a further opportunity to work with event listeners and array sorting methods to allow the user to input new books, remove books and sort their library.

For now this data is not designed to be persistent. In the future it could be expanded to include a back-end or make use of localstorage.
